# mtga-log-client

Simple client for passing relevant events from MTG Arena logs to the 17Lands REST endpoint.

## Usage

To run, simply enter `seventeenlands` in your terminal. On first run, you will be prompted for your user token.

## Local Development Tools

It is recommended to do local development in a [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) In order to set
up a virtualenv for this project, run the following:
```shell
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv venv
. ./venv/bin/activate 
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To leave the virtualenv, simple run the following:
```shell
deactivate
```

### Mypy

This project requires usage of type hinting. This is enforced using
[mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/). The configuration we have set for mypy enforces every
function declaration to have type hints, including an explict `None` return type if
applicable.

Run the following from inside the virtualenv to validate types:
```shell
mypy --install-types --non-interactive
mypy seventeenlands
```
